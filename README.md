## RR COURSE - 'BECOME A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER' 2ND WEEK PROJECT

The objective of the first week was to create screensflows of a new page for the company Trackgenix.

The company Trackgenix SA provides software development services to other companies,and has asked us to develop a web system that facilitates the recording of hours worked by each employee in each project and work team.

The problem of week 02 is to create an HTML document that has the same content as the landing of the screenflow of the first week.

## What will we find on the page?
- A sidebar where you can redirect us to home, sign up and sign in. It will also contain the contact of the company.
- An article explaining what trackgenix is dedicated to.
- Features section.
- Information Section
- History of the company. 
- And a section of products, company and suport.

## Content
In this repository you will find:

- An HTML index file with the structure of the layout
- a folder called "images" that contains all of the images used in the page

## Executing

To run the program you must double click on the index file, where you will open the trackgenix page in your browser
